# SOLID Principles

* Introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob);
* The term SOLID was coined by Michael Feathers;
* The goal of this principles is to make software more understandable, improving the software maintainability and extensions; 

## Single responsibility principle

Every module, class or function should have only one reason to exist.

## Open/closed principle

Classes, modules, functions should be open for extensions, but closed for modification;

## Liskov substitution principle

## Interface segregation principle

No class/client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use

## Dependency inversion principle

* High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
* Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
